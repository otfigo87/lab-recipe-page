        <h1>Vanilla Cupcakes</h1>
        <p>
          Everyone loves cupcakes! This is the only vanilla cupcake recipe you
          will need. They are super easy to make and the texture is light,
          fluffy, and melt-in-your-mouth good.Watch the video tutorial below and
          you will be a pro in no time. We love these with our Cupcake Frosting
          because a cupcake isnâ€™t a cupcake without frosting.
